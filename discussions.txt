Cohorts
    - would it make sense to separate cohorts based on pillars of our engineering
			- data, web/mvc, product/research, ui/ux graphics
		
    - python, why should we learn it, can we motivate those who don't use it?
        - maybe we can get everyone excited about using it and create a culture around it
        - maybe pick a new language every year? or have 2 at a time so those who know python already can do C#..?

3-29-22 - 3T
    - MVC vs MVVM, examined LearnosityPlayer
    - seems like we are doing a mix of both
    - services could be models, Microsoft likes to say models should be clean
    - could leverage more razor when delivering our views like speedgrader and class summary

    - NS: think about resources involved in our apps, what would controllers look like?

    - you are the bridge
	- get to where you can teach
	- knowing which technique to use is key
	- work should be with someone always
	- use git commit tools so you have visibility in code, coauthor
	- learn from those who you mentor, equal collaboration
		- call out when you learn something, "thanks for showing me that"
		- this shows vulnerability and builds culture
		- 
	- be careful of killing curiosity, use "I think" instead of "this is how"
	- remember 1n1s are bi-directional, say "less experienced" instead of "junior"
	- something you can always ask: what should I be doing more of, less of, not doing?
	- make sure people see me accepting feedback publicly
	- always have 2 mentorships and 2 menteeships
	- get a mentor outside the company
	- we can do ongoing sessions
	- how do you examine your practice, how do I know the things I am doing are working?
		- I thanked him for helping us grow and learn in #developers
		- if teaching technique, how will I know they have learned it?
	- 
	- talked about player launch and view controller and how we could reduce dependencies
	- improve while knowing you are enough and staying positive
