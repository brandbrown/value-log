Cohorts
    - python, why should we learn it, can we motivate those who don't use it?
        - maybe we can get everyone excited about using it and create a culture around it
        - maybe pick a new language every year? or have 2 at a time so those who know python already can do C#..?

- - - - - Past - - - - -

4-11-22 Cohorts 
    - what are the steps you take when doing a pull request?

4-8-22 - 3T
    - Learnosity Player expound on skinny controller
    - 3 steps to redesign
        - move non-resourceful controller to be resourceful ones
        - move logic from fat controllers to models
        - change routes to be resourceful (may not be needed, or not provide benefit)
    - We should be open to change tools if they do not make things fast
    - Make changes easy so you can make easy changes
    - we will have to determine .net conventions for fat models

    - work with growth plans that he is setting up
    - good to see follow up conversations after tech talks
    - keep team focus on topics 
    - influence growth but it does not have to be a goal
    - motivation could be an approach
    - see if we can split stories during decomp
        - dont start sprint until later in the day after decomp
    - plan during Planning
        - don't leave planning without having everything decomped
        - can anyone follow the steps?
    - growth plan doc: https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-P4Zziq1LkpUvTcpyYRgwJAldfWZCLRMebOjPj85WgQ/viewer?invite=CIK-wbwN&ts=624e03b2&token=AC4w5VjKL4Ut4nE0ionBd589OxUiC3uCUw:1649279953884

        - 


4-4-22 - SE3EM 1n1
    - Determine learning styles for menteeships

4-1-22 - SE1AD 1n1
    - LeetCode practice valid-parenthesis
    - used C#

4-1-22 - Team Meeting
        - SMLP Questions
            - How do we avoid increasing mistakes with multiple 'owners' of changes?
                - small commits
                - even current setup releases defects at times
            - Will they be on call?
                - eventually, needs time to get acclimated
                - hopefully we can use good apm to monitor defects 
            - How do we respond when things go wrong?
                - teams should be ready and willing to help
                - outages will take precedence over sprint work
        - New team formation
            - organize around epics
            - introduce opportunities for growth and cross pollination
            - How will epics be prioritized?
                - will still be per team
                - 1 epic per team per quarter
            - sounds like teams will not be able to pick epics
                - it will take time to shift from what we do now
                - how can we assure this will happen if this is what we want?
            - epics will get away from quarter
            - product will be shifting to use metrics to measure success
            - Will product be growing?
                - will ask in next 1n1
        - EM3MH will be alternating weeks on which team gets most time
        - Board improvements
            - we want to reduce invisible work
            - need to track triages, issue investigations, excited
            - what are the biggest things we do that cause invisible work?
            - should learning be tracked on the board?
                - no, only things with deliverables should be tracked
    

3-30-22 - OH SE4MN
    - Cohorts feedback
        - topics will change and not just be software coding
        - how do we keep people interested
        - teach if you already know something
        - would it make sense to separate cohorts based on pillars of our engineering
			- data, web/mvc, product/research, ui/ux graphics
         
    - Angular Jasmine testing findings

3-29-22 - 3T
    - MVC vs MVVM, examined LearnosityPlayer
    - seems like we are doing a mix of both
    - services could be models, Microsoft likes to say models should be clean
    - could leverage more razor when delivering our views like speedgrader and class summary

    - NS: think about resources involved in our apps, what would controllers look like?

3-25-22 - 1n1 SE4MN   
    - you are the bridge
	- get to where you can teach
	- knowing which technique to use is key
	- work should be with someone always
	- use git commit tools so you have visibility in code, coauthor
	- learn from those who you mentor, equal collaboration
		- call out when you learn something, "thanks for showing me that"
		- this shows vulnerability and builds culture
		- 
	- be careful of killing curiosity, use "I think" instead of "this is how"
	- remember 1n1s are bi-directional, say "less experienced" instead of "junior"
	- something you can always ask: what should I be doing more of, less of, not doing?
	- make sure people see me accepting feedback publicly
	- always have 2 mentorships and 2 menteeships
	- get a mentor outside the company
	- we can do ongoing sessions
	- how do you examine your practice, how do I know the things I am doing are working?
		- I thanked him for helping us grow and learn in #developers
		- if teaching technique, how will I know they have learned it?
	- 
	- talked about player launch and view controller and how we could reduce dependencies
	- improve while knowing you are enough and staying positive

3-22-22 - 1n1 SE1AD
    - SE3EM and I as mentors
	- Prefers maintenance oriented skills, refactoring, documentation
	- wants to solidify coding terminology like 'create a method' 'return an object' and other pop quiz type stuff
	- tackle easy wins in backlog
		- upgrade ckeditor
		- 

3-22-22 - 1n1 SE0DP
    - Think about setting a goal for us to work on
    - discussed options for things we could do together
        - code challenges
        - deep dive on something SE3EM mentions
        - pop quiz on code topics
